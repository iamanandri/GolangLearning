# GoLang Learning
Hello, everyone, this is just me trying out, learning and playing around with GoLang, hope you find anything useful or at least entertaining here. Feel free to contact me for things I could learn or improve! ^^

The materials I'm learning from:
- [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
- [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com)
