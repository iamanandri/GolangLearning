# GoLang Learning
Hello, everyone, this is just me trying out, learning and playing around with GoLang, hope you find anything useful or at least entertaining here. Feel free to contact me for things I could learn or improve! ^^

Things are probably moved from here to its own repo depending on the project

You gotta have [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) in your system to test out the programs and stuff.

The materials I'm learning from:
- [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
- [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com)
